# Pale Moon for Linux installer

- Version 0.2.3

---

## Using the installer

- Extract the contents of the archive to your home directory.
- Run the "pminstaller.sh" script from the file manager by double clicking on 
it. If this does not work for some reason, then enter the following into a 
terminal window:

    ~/pminstaller.sh

  (Assuming the "pminstaller.sh" script is placed in the home directory, as 
mentioned above).
- Follow the on-screen prompts to download and install Pale Moon.

Notes:

- At this time, the pminstaller can only download and install the latest 
version of Pale Moon. If you need a specific version of the browser, you'll 
have to download and extract it manually.
- Some file managers treat the pminstaller.sh file as a normal text file and 
will try to open it as such (in a text editor). In such cases you must run the 
installer in a terminal using this command: 
/path/to/the/installer/pminstaller.sh
- Do not invoke the installer as root (e.g. "sudo ./pminstaller.sh"). On some 
distros, the sudo command will strip the XAUTHORITY variable (without which any 
graphical program cannot run). The installer automatically elevates itself 
using su(do).
- If you recieve a "Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display" error when trying to 
run the installer, ensure that xhost is installed on your system then try to 
run the installer again.
- The installer may not run on some "lightweight" distributions since the 
standard command line tools use busybox (which does not implement all features 
of the required command line tools).
- If the installer does not run because the built-in copy of yad complains 
about being unable to load a particular library, then you likely do not have 
the basic dependencies required for any recent Mozilla based product. Please 
update the related libraries and try again.
- If you have any specialized requirements that the installer does not serve 
out of the box, then please use the manual installation instructions on the 
Pale Moon for Linux site (https://linux.palemoon.org/help/installation/).
- For further information, please check the pminstaller release notes or visit 
the forum.
